About Us  

Founding Story If needed, find here Image of Fiona and Linda.
During Linda Tusiime’s journey with breast cancer in 2017, she was faced with the dilemma that many people who’ve been diagnosed are faced with – where can I get information? (A question that closely follows fear of the severity of cancer). She frantically searched online for young women like her who had faced a similar experience but only found voices from outside Uganda. Voices she could not relate to. So, she started a blog – Lumps Away. It was her way of sharing her ordeal while also connecting with others out there to help each other through their shared journeys.

In 2019, with her friend, Fiona Toliva, Lumps Away shifted from being a blog to a Cancer Survivorship and Advocacy Organization. The Lumps Away Foundation is an organization built on hope and a passion for helping those going through pain we’ve known intimately. Our mission is to create a safe space for women, men, caregivers, friends, and more who are affected by the nightmare that is cancer. We do what we can to help, bring awareness, and be an emotional support while making the lives of those affected by it a little easier. We can’t fix it all, but we can do our best.
If you care about our cause or are just curious, join us; we’re always looking for the extra hand.

Why support us?
We started Lumps Away because we knew intimately the gaps that exist when facing cancer in our community. When you support us, you're investing in giving hope to patients by making vital cancer information accessible in our local context, providing community connections when people feel most alone, and delivering tangible support through programs like scholarships that keep children in school despite family health crises, and skills training that helps survivors rebuild their livelihoods.

You're not just supporting an organization - you're helping build the community of care that transforms how cancer is experienced in Uganda. Support us because together, we're proving that from the pain of cancer can come the most beautiful growth.
