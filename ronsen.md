OUR HISTORY:
Ronsen Hope Christian Foundation Uganda started in 2016 after the death of our Father Late Ssemukuutu Charles.He used to help a number of children in our community and he was so passionate about rescuing those vulnerable children and orphans who were facing difficulties in life even if he was not a rich man. He could feed, shelter and give them some aid in sponsoring their education. When he died a number of needy children suffered because they were depending on him. I sat down with my Mother and my two young Sisters, Rev. Sr. Nandyowa Slyvia and Nabuule Sarah and we discussed how we can continue with our father's passion of supporting the needy and i came up with an idea of setting up an orphanage here at home evenif the place wasnot big enough. They supported my passion and idea of setting up an orphanage. I came up with the name "RONSEN" i abbreviated it from my name RONALD SSENFUMA and we registered it as Ronsen Hope Christian Foundation Uganda. We started with 15 children whom the Late Father had left at our home. Me and my mum struggled alot to look after these children because we didnot have any job at that time, we could seek support from our church St. Agnes Catholic church kibuye - Makindye, community leaders and entire community. In 2021 God blessed us with a first donation from Pastor Frank Hurley the President of Equipping the Saints Global from USA who blessed us with bibles, food and scholarstic materials.This motivated us to continue with our Godly mission of helping vulnerable children in our communities. Later on other supporters joined us from USA, UK, Canada and Spain this boosted us alot because we could give more assistance to a number of needy children. 
What sparkled us to shift from our home and rent a place where we are now. The first challenge we experienced was the place was too small to accomodate all of us and the children and another obstacle we faced was our relatives who didnot want this idea of making our family home an orphanage so we decided to rent another place where we could use as our orphanage.Renting this place which we use as our orphanage and a school at the same time helped us to rescue and help many vulnerable Orphans and children who were facing difficulties in life. Always we give the Glory to God who makes every thing possible. WHO WE ARE :

MINISTRIES :
CHRIST AMBASSADOR CHILDREN CHOIR:
Comprises exceptionally talented children from all our school and orphanage . The primary purpose of this Choir is to nurture talent and fundraise to support the work of Ronsen Hope Christian Foundation Uganda  in looking after and caring for orphaned and destitute/underprivileged children/youth and their families.
Music brings so much joy into a person’s life, and we realized that the Choir would be a means of brightening up the lives of these young ones without pondering about their background. It is also another way of communicating with those who enjoy music and others who need a special touch by listening to music.
The Choir also aims to:
Promote, appreciate and develop the skills of young talented artists.
To inculcate in them a sense of creativity, self-motivation, and evaluation and to maintain the skills acquired.
To learn to appreciate and exchange their desirable and acceptable culture with other communities worldwide.

RONSEN SOCCER ACADEMY :
We train children to community work like digging, washing, and other vocation training like sweater knitting, and many others. This is basically so to cater properly for the better standards of living as principles on which the soccer academy was established
Community work: the academy has a total of two leaders mandated to provide community work to orphans. All these leaders are doing it on a charity basis. They are headed by Ssenfuma Ronald the founder and experienced in humanity, charity and institutional management.
Vocational work: As earlier pointed out, these vocational trainings are done at the church because our academy is lacking enough land, so we do our vocational work at the church. And it’s a must every orphans to get time and read bible for the better becoming closer to God day by day and religious education services to orphans
Co-curriculum activities: As mandated by the national regulator, all orphanage homes ought to conduct these activities. Notable among them are; games and sports, talent exploration i.e. Music Dance and Drama, Leadership promotion clubs like patriotism clubs among others. We train them.World War I. This made it a point of principle that Uganda is to be an African state. The economics of the protectorate support this policy. Uganda grew prosperous as cotton, introduced by the British, grown with great success by African peasant farmers.

By the 1960s, Uganda had brilliant young educated Africans who had learned much about British rule and later got the urge to liberate this East African country from the British. Britain granted Uganda full internal self-government in March 1962. In the following month, Milton Obote of Uganda People’s Congress (UPC) got elected the first prime minister. It is he who negotiated the terms of the constitution under which Uganda becomes independent on 9th October 1962.
From then, Uganda has changed governments in the struggle to irk Uganda’s social, economic, and political gestures with the current National Resistance Movement (NRM) headed by His excellence Yoweri Kaguta Museveni.

Under his rule, social, economic, and political strategies have been laid thus rising Uganda to fame especially in the Tourism, Sports, Trade, and International Relations as concerned with a strong Army uphold that has helped keep Africa at peace through the Uganda People’s Defense Force (UPDF)

Therefore Uganda continues working on its target of being a middle-income state by 2030 and the sole aim of keeping and making East Africa one, through the East African Community in a bid to rise to fame.
Where is Uganda?

Uganda is a country is located in the African continent within the East African region. It covers 197,100 square kilometers of land and 43,938 square kilometers of water, making it the 81st largest nation in the world with a total area of 241,038 square kilometers.

Uganda is surrounded by neighbors with whom it is on good terms. These are:

Tanzania – South
Uganda’s latitude and longitude the country are 1.1027° N, 32.3968° E. and use a currency called shillings ( /=).
Geographically, gallant Uganda is a landlocked country but with excellent relief. The pearl of Africa is dubbed with different beautiful gifts which make the relief of Uganda appreciable. With some areas of Uganda being mountainous, the creation of beautiful scenery lives the country adorable. The mountainous zones lift the relief of Uganda through the provision of rains, support the mining sector and tourism.

With some parts covered by the plateau, People in Uganda never regret settlement. The existence of great relief has prompted it to even become more hospitable towards refugees due to land that can accommodate people to live peacefully.

Uganda is a land of shimmering lakes and turbulent rivers, with over a third of the country covered by water. Lake Victoria, on the southern boundary, is the largest lake in Africa and the source of the River Nile.

As a country of many wonders, Uganda has a lot to offer to its people and even visitors who are hospitably welcomed as tourists. A country gifted by nature, with so many thrilling adventures and attractions, the diversity of its beauty emanates from the enticing nature.

At the beginning of the 20th century Winston Churchill, a British colonial officer on a visit to Uganda said “…for magnificence, for variety of form and color, for the profusion of brilliant life – plant, bird, primates, insect, reptile, and beast – for the vast scale… Uganda is true “the pearl of Africa. Uganda, in the heart of East Africa, is full of the wonders of nature. With landscapes ranging from snowcapped peaks like Rwenzori, through broad savannah and tropical rainforests to arid deserts, as well as significant wetlands, Uganda is undoubtedly a special place. Nestling in the western arm of the African Rift Valley, Uganda has flora and fauna species found in East and West Africa, as well as an amazing range of its endemic species.

Uganda’s wildlife is sensational and, because of current conservation programs in Uganda, stocks are increasing annually. Tourists come from all over the world to see some of the more than 3,463 species of birds. These are complemented by stunning clouds of butterflies and moths. In all areas of the country, the flora is impressive: whether it is the high montane forest or grass-covered river banks, the beauty of the plants and flowers will overwhelm you.

When you discover Uganda is like experiencing Africa at its most spectacular. With a sizeable part of the country now protected through national parks and conservation areas, visitors have the choice of great undertaking a tour safari in Uganda, hiking in the mountains, gorillas trekking safari in Uganda, or just walking by the river banks. Whether you are out to explore or simply to relax, Uganda’s natural attractions will leave you touched by Africa’s magic spell.

The animal and plant life in Uganda is a diverse lot. The cooler western highlands contain a higher proportion of long grass and forest. In the extreme southwest, however, cultivation is intensive even on the high mountain slopes. In the drier northern region, short grasses appear, and there are areas of open woodland; thorn trees and Borassus palms also grow. The flora of Uganda is divided mainly between dense forests of Mvuli trees and expanses of tall elephant grass. Thus, enhancing opportunities to undertake nature walk safaris in Uganda.

On the other hand, Fauna in Uganda comprises animals, birds, insects, and also fish. The inventory of animal fauna is almost endless; however, the chief of them are the gorillas, chimpanzees, and the black rhinoceros. Some of the other animals that form a part of that list are leopards, elephants, lions, crocodiles, hippopotamuses, buffaloes, giraffes, zebras, various species of antelopes, gazelles, and topis. The Uganda kob is a specialty of the country. At least 6 mammal species are found only in Uganda. Birds are equally plenty. The birds of Uganda include the crowned crane (the national emblem), bulbul, weaver, crow, shrike, heron, egret, ibis, guinea fowl, mousebird, lourie, hornbill, pigeon, dove, eater, hoopoe, darter, lily-trotter, marabou stork, kingfisher, fish eagle, and kite. Having a variety of birdlife in Uganda has led to the emergence of ultimate birding safaris.

There are relatively few varieties of fish, but the lakes and rivers contain plentiful stocks of tilapia, Nile perch, catfish, lungfish, elephant snout fish, and other species. Crocodiles, too, are found in many areas and are particularly evident along the Nile between the Kabalega (Murchison) falls and Lake Albert. There is a wide variety of snakes, python, green snakes, black but the more dangerous varieties are rarely observed; presenting great opportunities for fishing safaris in Uganda.

At least a visitor will not miss seeing all these on any Uganda safari vacation.much more.

Of recent, Uganda was rated best Chapatti eating and making country, therefore, the beautiful food for all ages can be made with meat, salads and many more giving you a classic taste. For Uganda’s food / culinary tours, you cannot miss out on food events like Agricultural Expos, the Rolex Festivals, and wines among others.Indeed when anou make an Uganda Tour, expect to taste the best African cuisine at all times with the now western foods added on the menu.intense scrutiny and criticism. U.S.-sponsored abstinence promotions received recent criticism from observers for denying young people information. About any method of HIV prevention other than sexual abstinence until marriage.

HIV/AIDS is prevalent in Jinja and Masaka. To stem the spread of HIV there is much work to be done. As well as to care for people living with HIV/AIDS and their families. FSD works to support bottom-up strategies in addressing the virus and its many complex issues and social structures. Interns and volunteers assist a vast network of HIV/AIDS programs that serve communities. That has been drastically affected by the virus. Basic medical treatment and health education are also provided by FSD to productively support a growing population.Youth Unemployment
The International Labour Organisation defines youth unemployment as a share of the labor force age 15-24 without work but available for and seeking employment.

With a population of 37 million people, where young people count for about 78 percent below the age of 30. And 52 percent below the age of 15. Uganda is one of the countries with the youngest population who are dependents after Niger.

Uganda is trying its level best to introduce schemes that could help alleviate poverty but with little success. Some of the schemes failed to succeed due to corruption. The “Entandikwa” failed because recipients failed to pay back part of 9.4 billion. The program managed to recover only 358 million in loans. This program did not achieve its purpose.

In Uganda after graduating the job market is filled with a total of 400,000 youth evey year. To a market that has only 90,000 jobs. That means that the rest of the youth who have graduated will have no jobs. Because the job market is small. And therefore if the youth does not create a job, we will see many walking the streets. Identifying positions that are either vacant or still occupied by people who need to retire.

Girl Child Education
There are quite many factors that have led to an increase in many girls dropping out of school. Many of these drop out of school before reaching primary seven.

According to the 2016 current District Education Officer (D.E.O) of Gulu District, Rev. Vincent Oceng-Ocen, 15% of girls in primary schools drop out before completing primary seven. While the percentage of boys dropping out stands at only 10%.

Gulu has only 155 primary schools under the Universal Primary Education (UPE) program with a total of 112,676 pupils. The percentage of girls who have enrolled in primary school this year stands at 48% while for boys it’s 52%. This is only 57% of school-age going children in Gulu while 43% have never gone to school.

Significant barriers to education in Uganda include poverty, child labor, distance from school, teenage pregnancies, child marriages. And unequal access to education due to gender and cultural factors. Over the last decade, there has been increasing awareness of the impact of conflict on education systems. And the importance of education for children and youths as part of post-conflict reconstruction in Northern Uganda.
 In Uganda, the Forum for African Women Educationists (FAWE) in 2011 conducted a survey. This reveals that the drop out of girls from school is increasing. And this is due to teenage pregnancies at 34%, poverty at 28%, and engagement in sex at 11%.

Stakeholders are expected to “increase school participation, completion and achievement rates of girls in primary education. Like Akello, through addressing the various barriers to girls’ education. Such as sexual and gender-based violence, poor sanitation, and poor management of menstruation, among others”.

Statistics of the Gulu district show that here there are more girls than boys now enrolling for primary education. But more boys complete school than girls. The reverse is true for the completion rate and Primary Leaving Examination (PLE) performance index. Boys who complete primary education in Gulu stand at 96%. While only 74% of girls complete primary education over the same period. Only 58% of girls pass their exams in Gulu as compared to boys whose percentage is 63% percent.
