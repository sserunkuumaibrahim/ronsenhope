CAROL’S STORY
This is a FOUR PART story of a friend and avid supporter of the work being done by the Lumps Away Foundation. A survivor close to our hearts who is brave enough to share her ordeal with breast cancer. Feel free to contact us incase you want to reach out to her.
 
Bio
Carol is a 31 year old survivor of breast cancer. She lives in Kamwokya with her 15 year old daughter, who dreams of making the world a better place. Before her diagnosis, she was a teacher at a nursery school, and she hopes to further her education one day with another professional skills course. In the meantime, Carol channels her passion for helping others who are going through challenges, by dedicating her time doing volunteer work with the Uganda Women’s Cancer Support Organization (UWOCASO), and providing support to patients receiving treatment at the Uganda Cancer Institute.
 
How it all began
In mid-2015, I noticed a lump in my breast, and as you can imagine, I didn’t think much of it until I began to feel a bit uncomfortable. Due to financial constraints, I just went to a neighborhood clinic to get it checked out. I was confident I would get the best within my limited finances from there because the nurse I saw also worked at the Mulago National Referral Hospital in Kampala. When this nurse felt this lump, she told me it was a milk duct.
 
“You have breastfed before, no? That’s not unusual, milk ducts are quite normal.”
 
I don't have a medical background, so personally, when someone in that starched white uniform says all is well, then all is well. Reassured, I went back home and continued to live my life.
 
But I continued to feel it, and worse, it was growing! But I reminded myself that the professional said it was nothing to be concerned about…..To be fair though, a lot of it was about my financial situation. As a nursery school teacher at the time, I earned just UGX 200,000 (USD53) per month. At this point, my daughter and I were living with my brother, who was catering to us both as well as paying for her education, so I honestly couldn’t bring myself to ask for more. I honestly believe that if I had the resources, I would have pursued it further.
 
The chickens come home to roost
Fast forward to 2018. I had, by this time, moved to Mukono and my sister came by my place for a visit.  On this fateful day, she somehow noticed a dimpling on my breast that I had been ignoring, but she insisted I needed to get it checked out. She immediately called a friend of hers, a Gynecologist, and asked that I see him. Because of how alarmed she sounded, I started to feel panicked and instead chose to call a friend who worked at Naguru Hospital back in Kampala, who immediately arranged for me to see a doctor there.
 
I remember it was a Tuesday. I was seen by an intern whose area of specialization was breast health. An ultrasound scan was carried out, but the results were unclear because the machine was faulty. Regardless, despite these ‘unclear’ results, I was told it was not serious, and to go back after 3 months to check again.
 
Within the 3 month period, my sister was still concerned and thankfully, her doctor friend covered the cost for me to go to a private hospital in Kampala. The doctor was of the view that I was too young to have breast cancer, but wanted to be sure nonetheless to put our minds at ease. I proceeded to have a mammogram done at Kampala Imaging Centre, but it was not conclusive because the ‘tumor’ appeared to be deep inside in body. You see, it was growing inwards, and even though I didn’t know what that meant, I imagined it was something serious. An ultrasound was thereafter recommended after which the doctor asked me, “How long have you had this tumor? This result is not good.”
 
I don’t think I will ever forget those words for as long as I live.
 
Following the ultrasound results, the doctor recommended I do a biopsy. Again, I relied on my sister and her doctor friend who got me to have one done through a colleague of his. One week later I received the results, but the words I saw were very technical and I couldn’t understand any of it. And it took me a while to get a hold of the doctor to interpret the results for me. When I finally did, one evening in a taxi, on my way home from work, I was on the phone with her.
 
After I read the report for her, she said, “Carol, according to the biopsy results, you have cancer. You should come back to see me so we agree on a treatment plan.”
 
I’ve never had to fight back tears as much as I did in that taxi. And then again at home, where I didn't want to scare my 10-year-old daughter. But it was a hard evening.

Next steps – seeking solutions for my reality
The very next day, I went back to this doctor at her private clinic. Her immediate recommendation was to have surgery done. That was it. That was the only treatment plan I was offered at that point. Nor did she refer me to anyone or even mention the Uganda Cancer Institute (UCI) in Mulago Hospital. She convinced me that the situation could be managed at her clinic. She asked me to meet with her sister (a well renown breast surgeon) to examine me and decide when an operation could be done.
 
Initial estimate of the costs were; Surgery – UGX 1,500K, Admission – UGX 50K a night for a week, Anesthesia – UGX 800,000. I was teary-eyed just from hearing these figures. Remember, this is a private practice and I am still only just making UGX200K as a nursery teacher.
 
Realizing I would need at least UGX 4,000K – money I obviously did not have, I told the doctor I would get back to her when I was ready. But I knew I couldn’t afford it. Even when I told my family about the cost, I knew it was a tough ask and they were not able to give me more than they had already done for me at this point.
 
One day, lady in my church heard about my situation and told me about the Uganda Cancer institute. She referred me to go and speak to a friend of hers who worked there who may be able to share some information about what other options I had. Naturally, I voiced my concern about the financial implication, to which she said. “It is a government facility. You will not be asked to pay for anything.” Ah, now this was music to my ears!
 
With renewed hope, I made my way to the hospital first thing on a Wednesday morning at 7am. I got to see a doctor, who told me that while the results were suspicious, they could not start treatment based on them and more confirmatory tests would need to be done. He proceeded to give me a note of the tests I’d need to do that could be done at the institute.
 
On getting out of the office, I meet one of the nurses who asked what I’d been advised. Believing that this nurse was going to act on the doctor’s instructions, I promptly shared and waited for advice on where to go next. I was so hopeful that I was on the right path. But she quickly shattered my happy thoughts when she exclaimed, “Do not do treatment at the cancer institute. They will put you on chemotherapy there and you will die!”
 
Again, I’m a believer in authority figures. Here was a nurse, who had experience with cancer patients, working in a big hospital, speaking with conviction about chemotherapy and death. Of course, I paid attention. It also did not escape me that the only stories I’d heard about chemotherapy were not pleasant. I believed her and asked what she recommended instead. She said she knew a lady who offers nutrition based and herbal treatments. I only had to pay a small fee (UGX 30K) for her fuel so she could take me there. And so we went.
 
……………………………….END PART 2……………………………………………………
A diversion
We went to a modern building with offices and shops. In one of them, was the ‘office’ of the nutrition lady. She looked at my breasts and briskly said, “I give you 3 months for that dimpling to go, if you follow my instructions.” It sounded too good to be true but I was desperate for some good news and she seemed to be offering it. Now the cost. Her recommendations were a collection of fruits from her that would cost me at least UGX 20K per day, 5am daily exercise and couple more instruction’s that she wrote down for me. As good as it sounded, this option was not affordable for me either.
 
By this point, I had lost my job because I was constantly away seeking medical help, and I was living with a friend who once again brought up the Uganda Cancer Institute again as an option to consider seriously. I was not eager to go back after what happened the last time but he insisted I speak with a friend of his that worked for a nonprofit within the UCI compound. I had nothing to lose at this point, and I felt like I had run out of options so I begrudgingly went and met this friend.
This time it was different.
On arriving at UCI, this person held my hand, took me straight to the Head of UCI, and it was then that I heard the magic words that no one had really told me before. If it isn’t obvious by now, my main concern was the financial cost of dealing with the treatment. But I was told that there were cost free treatment options at UCI. Free treatment! How was this just coming to my attention after all this time? For the first time since this ordeal, I could finally breathe. I almost laughed with the joy that I felt after knowing that there was hope.
 
Back on the road to treatment
Another sample was taken for a biopsy and on the 15th December 2018, I got the results that confirmed that I had Stage 3 cancer. Because it was the end of the year, most people were already on their break for the holidays, so I had to wait to start treatment. My New Year 2019 started with apprehension of what was to come.
 
I started my first round of chemotherapy on 3rd January 2019. Because the lump was so large, it needed to shrink a bit with this treatment before surgery could be performed. I did chemotherapy for five months.
 
One crucial aspect about care in these circumstances is mental health support.  I realize now that everything I had been doing the entire time was out of denial – be it going to work or even hospital. I was on auto pilot. But when I started the treatment, I knew I needed to have something else to focus on besides my state of affairs. A job that could help me afford the aftercare that I needed while I was on treatment. Fortunately, I was able to get a volunteer role with the Uganda Child Cancer Foundation (UCCF). My schedule revolved around doing the treatment, recuperating for one week then showing up to work the next week until I was done with the cycles.
 
Chemotherapy was such a nasty experience. I can’t even begin to describe it in words that would make sense. I had absolutely no appetite in the first week, and by the second week when my sense of taste was beginning to return, I couldn’t even bring myself to eat because of the anxiety for the next round.
 
The dreaded surgery, and more bad news
Then came the surgery. It had to take some convincing for me to accept it. This is why I cannot emphasize enough the need for someone to talk to, a support network that includes some sort of therapy.  It was only when I spoke with a colleague who’d had her entire reproductive system removed that I finally accepted the surgery. Speaking with her got to make me understand that while some things were tough, I would come out stronger and that my life really was at stake. She make me understand that the longer I delayed, the lower the opportunities for the doctors to be able to contain the situation and at a certain point there would be absolutely nothing they can do to help.
 
After the surgery was done, I was told that the tumor was found to be bigger than they’d anticipated. You see, it had already attached itself to my chest wall so even the procedure was complex. After it was all done, I came back home and rested for one month.
 
Perhaps I should do a better job of explaining the complexity of my case. When the surgery results came back, despite how much removal of the tumour had been done, the margins of what had been removed were positive. What this meant was that some cancerous cells had remained in my body. At this point, my doctor recommended more chemotherapy, but I’d already been on chemotherapy for almost half a year, and after the last round I couldn’t find the strength to go through it again. So, my doctor then suggested I get on radiotherapy immediately. Unfortunately for me, even though I started radiotherapy immediately as advised, the radiation machine at Mulago would break down frequently which impacted the full length of my treatment.
 
But that wasn’t the end of my troubles.
 
……………………………….END PART 3……………………………………………………
 
During this time, out of nowhere, I began to experience excruciating back pain. It was so bad that in order to get myself to work, I would wake up at 5am,  take a painkiller, and go back to bed to allow the painkiller to work before I got up to go to work. When it became unbearable, I returned to the doctor to figure out what was happening. A CT scan was done, and the results were so shocking I was put on emergency radiotherapy for 10 days.
 
I remember the doctor asking, “How are you still walking?”
 
The cancer had spread to the spine and eroded the L3 bone that supports the spine.  I had to wear a back brace, and re-train my back to support itself thereafter.
 
After all my necessitated rounds of radiation were done, I was once again put on chemotherapy - this time the oral kind for about 6 months. Along the way, I started having trouble breathing, and again, I went back to see the doctor. Another CT scan, and this time showing that the cancer had spread not only in the spine and bone, but now it was in my lungs too! I had fluid in my lungs and a very big tumor. Breathing became a laborious process, it was so difficult, and I couldn't walk a few meters without resting.
 
While all this was happening, because I was not losing weight (a side effect of one of the treatments was weight gain/bloating as my body fought it), there was some disbelief from some of my family that did not believe my situation was as bad as I communicated. It was such a tense time that I was accused of ‘acting up’, ‘seeking attention’ even. I had to share my results with a doctor friend of my family who also was surprised that I was able to walk at all. At this point, my family then suggested I move to the village since I had no job or sustenance in the city. They were willing to get me a room in the village since I could barely afford rent. When I asked if they would facilitate my movements twice a month to the hospital for treatment, there was silence. This was the best they could offer.
 
Honestly, I felt so scared and alone. But I had to keep up with the treatment. Otherwise, should I have doomed myself to die?
 
An ending to this story – but my journey goes on
 
And so, I started another aggressive phase of chemotherapy, twice a month, between August 2021 to October 2023. My body rejected the treatment, and it was changed after 8 months. In this period, my body continued to get more bloated, my fingers were so numb and I couldn’t feel my feet. My body temperature was also so low that I constantly felt cold. Imagine I was wearing gloves in the heat of Kampala.
 
The good news is after this treatment, another scan showed that the tumors and fluid were gone! Today, my back pain is not as bad as it was before, but I was still encouraged to continue supporting it and avoid strenuous activities. I was also put on oral chemotherapy which I still take to date, and will continue to, because all they can do now is to suppress and manage the cancer enough for me to live a productive life with minimal pain, as the cancer that I have is a metastatic cancer (has already gone to other parts of the body)
 
One of the things that kept me going through everything was getting involved in work at the Cancer Institute. I don’t know if I would be alive if it wasn’t for this. The support system I found in the staff cannot be measured – consider UCI my home (also, I was there so often, how could it not be). Additionally, it was through talking to people and a nurse at UCI that I was convinced to have the surgery done. Another great support was from the Uganda Women’s Cancer Support Organisation (UWOCASO) - a nonprofit organization that I now volunteer with.
Throughout my treatment at the Cancer Institute, never paid for anything - I never paid for chemotherapy, I never paid for blood tests, I never paid for CBC, never paid for organ function tests. One of my main concerns from the very start was finances. It’s the reason I ignored any sense of pain, any discoloration. It’s the reason I was willing to seek help from nutritionists. It’s the reason I went back home with my biopsy results, knowing what was wrong but being helpless to do anything about it. Taking the financial load off my medical journey is the reason I am alive to share my story today. I still don’t really have a steady source of income, especially since I can’t work like I did before, so I get by with allowances from the volunteering work that I do.
 
I sometimes think about how my life would have gone if I had sought help from the very start. But I can’t dwell on these thoughts.
 
For now, I am grateful. I am alive.
